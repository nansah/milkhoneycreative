                    Growing up, as a first generation Ghanaian American, I would often get custom garments sewn for
                    various occasions.

                    Depending on the event, sometimes we’d coordinate using the same fabric and dress codes.

                    Besides the richness of the fabric, what I love about creating bespoke garments is you’re able to
                    add your own personal flair and never worry that you’ll show up to an event with the same outfit as
                    another guest! </p>

                <h2> Business Opportunity </h2>
                <p>As of 2022, African immigrants make up almost 2M of the 4.6M Black Immigrant population with
                    potential to double by 2060.

                    580,000 are from Ghana and Nigeria, communities that strongly embrace their cultures and are widely
                    known for lavish Wedding Celebrations and colorful fabrics.

                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    The problem is that people within the African diaspora have a difficult time finding trustworthy
                    seamstresses due to technology constraints and lack of verified sources.
                </p>

                <h2>Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    Design a digital directory for users to find vetted seamstresses</p>

            <p>
                I followed the design thinking framework for this project. Initially, I assumed this concept was
                something
                that needed to be on the market based on my own personal experience. During the discovery phase, I was
                able
                to find an existing proof of concept and conduct further research to validate the concept with user
                interviews and understand their pain points and core needs. </p>

                <h2>User Interviews</h2>
                <p>The interview sample took into account women between 18 - 45, based in the US and of African Descent.
                    I
                    arranged 6 interviews about 30 minutes each and asked questions about their dressmaking process and
                    experiences.

                    I asked: </p>
                <ul> What led you to begin your search for a seamstress? </ul>

                <ul>How did you find your seamstress?</ul>

                <ul>Did you experience any issues during the dressmaking process?</ul>

                <ul>How did you communicate with your seamstress?</ul>

                <ul>How could your experience have been improved?</ul>

            <h2>Defining the User </h2>
            <p>Most of the interview participants were of african descent and worked in the tech or health
                profession
                and were often either brides or guests at an upcoming event. This led me to define 2 core users.</p>

            <h2>Identifying User Needs</h2>
            <p>
                Trust was a huge concern for the interview participants, so I deduced to address this factor,
                information about the seamstress including their experience, skills, portfolio and reviews will add more
                social proof and ease customers.

                <h2> Competitive Analysis</h2>
                <p>Direct Competitor
                    There is nothing currently existing in the market with this concept. I did come across Tailoring
                    Needs (defunct), another company also help clienting find the nearest custom-wear Fashion Designers.

                    This provides a proof of concept and they were able to solve a much needed problem within the
                    african community, garnering over 5k followers.

                    I was able to interview a few seamstresses on their experiences with the platform and a main point
                    of concern included customers having to pay to find the seamstress.

                    This could be a contributing factor to why it’s now defunct. Forcing customers to pay for the
                    platform would be a deterrent to using it especially because of the expected fee of paying the
                    seamstress</p>

                <h3>Indirect Competitors</h3>
                <p>Because there are no existing competitors, I searched for indirect competitors with similar
                    capabilities where one could potentially find a seamstress. Though all 3 have search functionality,
                    the ease of use
                    and searchability to find a seamstress was subpar.</p>

                <p>Instagram is not conducive to searching as you’ll have to use hashtags which are often populated
                    with other relevant posts.</p>

                <p>Google would be the first place to search for a seamstress however many are not registered. A search
                    yields 1-2 pages of results which were mixed with other businesses. With a combined population of
                    33,000 Nigerian & Ghanaian immigrants, we can assume this does not accurately reflect the number of
                    seamstresses in DTX.</p>

                <p> Etsy offers keyword suggestions when searching but most of the vendors do not provide bespoke
                    services. The african fashion items are primarily ready to wear. Lastly, the risk level involved
                    with
                    purchasing from an online vendor is too high.</p>
